## Contributing

Used JavaScript the native way with help of [MDN web Docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/JavaScript)

* I created the deck of cards that can be shuffled every game played.
* If all cards have matched, I created a display a message with the final score.
* I set up a timer that will display in seconds how long the player took to win.
* I made stars rating to win: 3 stars make matches under 20 moves, 2 stars under 30 moves and 1 star over 40 moves.
